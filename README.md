## Archived
Many commands have been archived due to them not being functional and breaking many of the time.
The only command that will survive this will be the role action command as that one has the fewest known bugs and works well.
This will mark a fresh start for me, and will be a chance for me to get a fresh start.
I will release commands here and there and update the old ones.
Archived commands will NOT be fixed and will no longer be futher supported.
Please look forward for my la
